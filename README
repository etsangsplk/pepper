pepper - SCM statistics report generator
========================================

About
-----
pepper is a flexible command-line tool for retrieving statistics and
generating reports from source code repositories. It ships with several
graphical and textual reports, and is easily extendable using the Lua
scripting language. pepper includes support for multiple version control
systems, including Git and Subversion. Using native language bindings,
multi-threading and a local revision cache, it provides fast access to
repository data.

This README file contains brief installation and usage
instructions. Additional documentation is available at
http://scm-pepper.sourceforge.net.


Requirements
------------
First, you need a working C++ compiler and standard library. Furthermore,
pepper depends on the following third-party software:

	* zlib
	* POSIX threads
	* Lua >= 5.1

The following dependencies are optional:

	* Python development files and the Mercurial modules (for the
	  Mercurial backend)
	* Subversion development files (for the Subversion backend)
	* The standard Git command line client (for the Git backend)
	* Gnuplot (for graphical reports)
	* Asciidoc and xmlto (for the man page)
	* lgob bindings to GTK3 (for the GUI report)

pepper has been written in a hopefully platform-independent manner,
and should compile and run on all major Unix platforms, e.g. Linux,
BSD and Mac OS X. I'm not planning to work too hard on a Windows port.


Compilation
-----------
pepper uses the Autoconf and Automake build systems, so the standard
way of running

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

should be fine. You can pass "--help" to the configuration script for
a brief version of the next two sections.

Additional instructions can be found in the INSTALL file included in
the source code distribution.


Available SCM backends
----------------------
pepper ships with the following backends. The respective command line
switches for the configuration script are given in brackets.

	* Git (--[en|dis]able-git)
	The Git backend uses uses the standard git command line client.

	* Subversion (--[en|dis]able-svn)
	This backend uses the Subversion C API to access the respective
	repositories. All access methods provided by the API are supported,
	e.g. file://, http:// or svn://.

	* Mercurial (--[en|dis]able-mercurial)
	The hg backend uses the Python C API to access Mercurial's
	python interface directly.


Optional features
-----------------
Several additional, optional features are available (see the CREDITS
file for more information about the respective libraries, if any)

	* Gnuplot interface (--[en|dis]able-gnuplot)
	A Lua interface to Gnuplot. Reports can use it to plot data
	graphically.
	This feature is enabled by default.

	* Man page (--[en|dis]able-man)
	pepper ships with a comprehensive man page, but both AsciiDoc
	and xmlto will be needed to generate it.
	This feature is enabled by default if the necessary programs
	are present.
