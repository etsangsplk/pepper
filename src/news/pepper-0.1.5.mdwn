Version 0.1.5 of pepper is now available. This release
adds a new report showing a histogram of file types in the
repository. The command-line argument for the repository can
be omitted now to use the current directory. Additionally,
the cache check is now performed by the new built-in `check_cache`
report. Two bugs reported by Dominik Geyer have been fixed (see
[#3162914](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3162914&group_id=386093&atid=1604684)
and
[#3162922](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3162922&group_id=386093&atid=1604684)).

Please refer to the [change log](ChangeLog) for a more detailed
listing. As usual, source tarballs can be found at the [[Download]]
section.
