pepper 0.1.3 is now available. This release adds a new report for
visualizing directory sizes and fixes several major bugs, including wrong
diff calls for merged revisions in the Git and Mercurial backend. Diffstat
data generated previously may be wrong, so old revision caches will be
invalidated automatically.

Please refer to the [change log](ChangeLog) for a more detailed listing.

As usual, source tarballs can be found at the [[Download]] section. The
[[Gallery]] page has been updated, so you can take a look at the new
report script.
