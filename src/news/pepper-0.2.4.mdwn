[[!meta title="pepper 0.2.4 released"]]

I'm happy to announce that version 0.2.4 of pepper is now available. This
is a bugfix release only, fixing a file name issue [reported by Merve
Yüzbaşıoğlu](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3386735&group_id=386093&atid=1604684),
that could cause errors when running the program against sub-directories of
Subversion repositories. Additionally, some minor fixes have been made
to the age report.

A more detailed listing of the changes can be found in the [change
log](ChangeLog). As usual, source tarballs can be found at the
[[Download]] section.
