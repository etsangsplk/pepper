pepper 0.1.1 is now available. This release adds a new report showing
commit times in a scatter plot and fixes several bugs.  Among others,
running built-in reports without specifying the full path and several
issues related to multi-threading have been fixed. The Lua detection
of the configure script should work automatically for most Linux
distributions now.

Source tarballs can be found at the [[Download]] section.
