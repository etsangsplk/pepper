[[!meta title="New Homepage"]]

I'm happy to announce that pepper's homepage is now generated using
[IkiWiki](http://ikiwiki.info), a nifty wiki compiler. The homepage
has been split into categories now, a navigation bar can be found on
top of the index page. There's also a lot of new content, including
[[documentation]] and a small [[scripting guide|ScriptingGuide]].

The source code of the website is available at
[GitHub](http://github.com/jgehring/pepper-hp).
