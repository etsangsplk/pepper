Version 0.2.1 of pepper is now available. This release focuses on the
Subversion backend implementation and contains new features as well as
bugfixes. The revision log for Subversion repositories is now cached
locally, resulting in a noticeable speedup for subsequent reports on
remote repositories. Furthermore, a working copy can now be used for the
repository URL. The bugfixes include several Subversion-related issues,
including possibly missing diffstats for deleted files and problems with
subdirectory handling.

A more detailed listing of the changes can be found in the [change
log](ChangeLog). As usual, source tarballs can be found at the
[[Download]] section.
