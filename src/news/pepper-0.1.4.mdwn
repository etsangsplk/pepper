[[!meta title="pepper 0.1.4 released"]]

Version 0.1.4 of pepper is now available. This release adds additional
report options for controlling the plot output, like the file name or
the image size.  Additionally, support for custom Subversion repository
layouts (trunk, branches and tag locations) has been added. A couple of
bugs have been fixed as well.

Please refer to the [change log](ChangeLog) for a more detailed
listing. As usual, source tarballs can be found at the [[Download]]
section.
