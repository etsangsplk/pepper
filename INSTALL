pepper - SCM statistics report generator
========================================

Basic installation
------------------
pepper uses the Autoconf and Automake build systems, so the standard
procedure using ./configure can be used. If you need more general
information on configure scripts as produced by Autoconf, please head to
http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Running-configure-Scripts
or pass `--help` to the configuration script.

The rest of this document decribes special configuration options
that are not covered by the standard Autoconf manuals.


Available SCM backends
----------------------
pepper ships with the following backends. The respective command line
switches for the configuration script are given in brackets.

	* Git (--[en|dis]able-git)
	The Git backend uses uses the standard git command line client.

	* Subversion (--[en|dis]able-svn)
	This backend uses the Subversion C API to access the respective
	repositories. All access methods provided by the API are supported,
	e.g. file://, http:// or svn://.

	* Mercurial (--[en|dis]able-mercurial)
	The hg backend uses the Python C API to access Mercurial's
	python interface directly.


Optional features
-----------------
Several additional, optional features are available (see the CREDITS
file for more information about the respective libraries, if any)

	* Gnuplot interface (--[en|dis]able-gnuplot)
	A Lua interface to Gnuplot. Reports can use it to plot data
	graphically.
	This feature is enabled by default.

	* Man page (--[en|dis]able-man)
	pepper ships with a comprehensive man page, but both AsciiDoc
	and xmlto will be needed to generate it.
	This feature is enabled by default if the necessary programs
	are present.

	* LevelDB support (--[en|dis]able-leveldb, --with-leveldb)
	This is an experimental feature which allows you to use LevelDB
	<http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/> for the revision cache. You
	can either use a propertly installed version or clone the official
	git repository into 3rdparty/leveldb.
	This feature is disabled by default.
